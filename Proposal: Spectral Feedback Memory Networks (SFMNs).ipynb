    "##### 1. Introduction\n",
    "I propose a novel AI architecture called **Spectral Feedback Memory Networks (SFMNs)**, inspired by my temporal spectral field framework. SFMNs incorporate dynamically regulated spectral memory, feedback-driven entropy control, chaos injection, and Lyapunov stability constraints to enable highly adaptable, stable, and entropy-aware learning systems.\n",
