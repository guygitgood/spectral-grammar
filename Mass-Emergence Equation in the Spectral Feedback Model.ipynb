    "**Mass-Emergence Equation in the Spectral Feedback Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Overview:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the emergent spectral feedback model, mass might be understood as a byproduct of internal entropy-regulating mechanisms, specifically spectral memory retention and feedback damping. As local entropy decreases, these internal mechanisms weaken, leading matter to exhibit increasingly light-like behavior.\n",

    "- Higher \\($\\tau$\\), \\($\\delta$\\): Stronger internal damping, stabilizing feedback → greater mass.\n",
    "- Lower \\($\\tau$\\), \\($\\delta$\\): Minimal damping → system transitions toward light-like behavior.\n",

    "##### **5. Potential Extensions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relativistic Coupling:**\n",
    "   - Incorporate relativistic gamma factors, connecting increased coherence with reduced inertia.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simulation Implementation:**\n",
    "   - Simulate entropy and feedback damping parameter reductions over time.\n",
    "   - Track emergent reduction in mass-like behavior, coherence increase, and light-like transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### **Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this spectral feedback model, matter transitions smoothly toward light-like behavior as local entropy approaches its minimal limit. The effective mass of any system is directly tied to its spectral entropy and internal feedback retention mechanisms, providing a coherent bridge between the nature of matter and light.\n",
