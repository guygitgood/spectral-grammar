    "\n",
    "##### Abstract\n",
    "This document connects equations from the Spectral Feedback Framework to the solution of classical and quantum N-body problems. By mapping particle interactions to spectral states and applying recursive updates, adaptive memory retention, and stability conditions, the framework resolves multi-body dynamics.\n",
