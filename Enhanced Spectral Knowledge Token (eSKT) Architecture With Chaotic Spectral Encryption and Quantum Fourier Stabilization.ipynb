    "#### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce a novel spectral AI framework integrating Enhanced Spectral Knowledge Tokens (eSKT), Chaotic Spectral Encryption (CSE), Lyapunov stability control, adaptive spectral memory, and Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) correction mechanisms. This architecture encodes dense, dynamic knowledge tokens that balance adaptability, coherence, and resilience. Through recursive spectral feedback, controlled chaos perturbations, and quantum readiness, the system demonstrates bounded spectral evolution, memory reinforcement, and stability across varying entropy regimes. Our implementation validates the framework's capacity for long-term spectral retention, dynamic phase interdependency, and emergent self-regulation.\n",

    "#### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The pursuit of efficient, scalable, and resilient knowledge representation systems necessitates frameworks that balance adaptability, stability, and entropy management. Enhanced Spectral Knowledge Tokens (eSKT) are designed to encode dense, interdependent knowledge units by leveraging spectral transformations, chaotic perturbations, and adaptive memory mechanisms. Integrating Chaotic Spectral Encryption (CSE) ensures security and resilience, while Lyapunov stability control enforces coherence and prevents divergence. Additionally, Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) integration prepares the architecture for quantum resilience and high-density spectral operations.\n",
